## Getting Started
The program focuses on Detecting Phishing Websites using Machine Learning to accurately detect the Phishing Websites. Phishing Websites targets the human vulnerabilities rather than the software vulnerabilities. It is the process of attracting online users in order to acquire the user’s sensitive information such as password and usernames. The program was developed using the Python programming language, the students programmed a machine learning algorithm in order to detect the phishing websites. The users of this program can use it to become aware on these phishing websites and protect their sensitive information by detecting phishing websites. 

Keywords: Phishing, Phishing Websites, Detection, Machine Learning. 

### Project Features
This repository contains a program that has three features, listed as follows:
  1. Detects phishing websites, most especially, those of e-commerce websites,
  2. Displays a list of blacklisted phishing websites, and
  3. Illustrates a brief description about the program and the developers behind it.

## Overview
The goal of this program is to build a safe and trustworthy environment again for the users of online communications or transactions. It construct a divers set of platforms and tools to identify what is fake to real websites that the users will use.
The content is based from the widening spread of technology around us that even fraudulent hackers can adopt and learn from it, that's why we want to help our people to have a secure and positive online technology mechanics.
The students created a program that detects phishing websites using machine learning algorithm that checks whether the website is phishing or a safe website. The students used their knowledge that they obtained in the subject CPE106L and created a project that detects phishing websites with the use of machine learning algorithm, phishing websites are then stored in a file so that the program can comprehend and compare the differences between a phishing website and a non-phishing website. 

### Requirements
* Any IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment Software), in this case, the developers used Visual Studio (VS) Code. <br />
To download, open your browser, head over to https://code.visualstudio.com/, and choose the software appropriate for your platform (Windows, Mac, or Linux).
* Python <br />
  Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language with a reference implementation that compiles source code into bytecode before being executed on a process virtual machine.
  If you don't have Python already installed, run the following commands to install Python3 and pip3, the package manager for Python, into your Linux installation.
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip3
```
And to verify, run:
```
python3 --version
```
##### Python Packages:
* **Pandas** <br />
  Pandas is a high-level data manipulation tool developed by Wes McKinney. It is built on the Numpy package and its key data structure     is called the DataFrame. DataFrames allow you to store and manipulate tabular data in rows of observations and columns of variables.
    - To install pandas using pip, type in the terminal:
    ```
    pip install pandas 
    ```
* **Numpy** <br />
  Numpy is the core library for scientific computing in Python. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and         tools for working with these arrays.
    - To install numpy using pip, type in the terminal: 
    ```
    pip install numpy
    ```
* **Random** <br />
  Random is a built-in module that you can use to make random numbers. Some of its features are securing random generator using a secrets module which generates secure tokens, security keys, and URL, set the state of a random generator, generate random strings and passwords, and etc.
* **SKLearn** <br />
  Scikit-learn is a free built-in machine learning library for Python. It features various algorithms like support vector machine, random forests, and k-neighbours, and it also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries like NumPy and SciPy.
 
##### Graphical User Interface (GUI) Packages:
* **PyQt5** <br />
  PyQt5 is one of the most used modules in building GUI apps in Python and that's due to its simplicity as you will see. Another great feature that encourages developers to use PyQt5 is the PyQt5 designer which makes it so easy to develop complex GUI apps in a short time.

##### Database Packages:
* **DBManager** <br />
  DBManager is the most powerful application for data management. With builtin support for MySQL, PostgreSQL, Interbase/Firebird, SQLite, DBF tables, MSAccess, MSSQL Server, Sybase, Oracle and ODBC database engines, it also brings you new features which make it the most advanced application.
* **SQLite 3** <br />
  SQLite is a C library that provides a lightweight disk-based database that doesn’t require a separate server process and allows accessing the database using a nonstandard variant of the SQL query language. Some applications can use SQLite for internal data storage. It’s also possible to prototype an application using SQLite and then port the code to a larger database such as PostgreSQL or Oracle.

### How to Use
## Target Audience
We would also like to expand our audiences as we program it for the users that has been having problem on not catching or even getting a justice on their stolen identities and personal information's.
As well as the fake transactions of name, password and personal bank accounts, the value and examples provided in our program is intended to be a widely solution on online underhand transfer.
## Focus Areas
This repository aims to give understanding on how Detecting Phishing Websites works.

### Scenarios
We aim to have scenarios that helps the users to be aware of Phishing Websites. This program helps user to distinguish whether the Website is a Phishinhg Website or a real website. We also want for our users to build their trust and have a safe and convenient online exchange. 

### Languages
The language that our program uses is SQL (Structured Query Language) is a database management language for relational databases. The programming language that the program uses is the Python programming language which is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics.
